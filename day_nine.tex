% The Fourteenth Day of the Ninth Moon, Year 735

% we're setting out
% wait! exposition
% ten years ago, went missing; son was one watch
% crazy powerful druid lady stole second gem three weeks ago, animated scarecrows over time. went east
% most recent one by druids and blights to southwest a few days ago
% purify wine, I take bottle
% set off after druids
% near hill with bunch of cairns and wall of boulders on hill, detect magic (evocation ring, necrotic roots)
% lightning keeps striking hill, illuminates tall fanged statue of Strahd with galthus roots
% poke roots with galtus staff
% 12 naked people burst out of graves, i hold up galthus staff "bow before galthus staff". prestidigitation of black smoke
% they get a bit confused, I run the fuck away with james. other three turn and fight
% lara yells "i see the tree on the other side!", me and james charge around that way
% get to tree, see battleaxe stuck in tree, see shamblers. charge at one so I can fireball group, shit goes crazy (bunch of needles, bunch of minies)
% i invis me and james and run toward caravan. meet up, drop invis, identify axe
% axe: blightcutter. when hits plant, takes extra 1d8. non-good aligned wielder makes sprout thorns (take 1 dmg)
% they stayed to get lara, made choke point, etc
%

% lara and ginelle reveal they lied and visited dragon temple, undead silver dragon, shit-tons of giant spiders, mausoleum, three story mansion on cliff
% ahh, scary
% plan how to go back in after resting
% start yelling at eachother
% dan smells sulfur, sees flaming horse flying at us
% dive into caravan, we leave
% head to winery, offer to bring wine to vistani, then maybe we'll head to swamp
% bring wine to vistani
% on the way, investigate blightcutter
% get to vistani camp, ginelle yells "we have the wine!"
% luvash greets us, praises us like heroes, offers 150gp per cask
% "have you seen arrigal?" "nope"
% head to swamp:
% as approach road, clouds thicken. dancing lights to ensure light
% sulfur. ginelle: "maybe strahd?"
% around bend, figure on flaming horse floating 15ft up
% is strahd
% fuck you for messing around with stuff, rude for taking book
% lara: "here, have it back!"
% strahd walks up to grab the book, ginelle casts daylight
% me: "kinnaeia, what did you do?"
% "if you take something of mine, I'll take something of yours"
% his shadow catches up to ginelle, grabs her shadow, rips and tears off her shadow
% he gets on horse, shadow-ginelle sits beside him, he takes off
%

% ginelle bolts away
% we continue a bit slowly so she can catch up, without wagon (dan ran off to get her)
% foggy village
% across river, figure eight of light
% look for boat. no, but river is gentle
% match light with mine, it stops
% ginelle: augury of crossing river, "good"
% cross river on horses
% light is held by monkey
% 12 stones (15ft tall) in circle, human tracks, no monkey tracks
% monkey disappears behind stone
% james finds note stuck on ground with dagger
% note: berez was abandoned long ago after the river rose and flooded the village. an ancient hag named babalisaga lives in a hut in the middle of the village. when not in her hut, she flies around in a giant skull. the scarecrows are murderous and under her control. they serve as a warning system. she has several mountain goats trapped near the old mansion. R. <- identified as rictavio because same writing, etc
% pick up dagger
% dan enters circle, we all bolt away
% dan: weird magical druidic power, "you should come in"
% ginelle enters circle
% james walks in
% dan goodberries, better effect, says he's super in tune with nature
% dan touches bear statue, becomes bear
% dan touches elk statue, nothing happens
% dan cancels and becomes human, touches elk, becomes elk
% ginelle runs forward and touches raven statue, nothing happens
% all leave circle (dan as panther), follow footprints. figure its rictavio, back off
% identify book: within 50ft no divination
% ginelle really wants to hold the book, we say no
% slowly head toward swamp
% approach town, nothing is moving
% lara checks out nearest hut, decaying 100yrs, less-decayed path toward center of town
% probs leads to hag? ginelle wants to kill her. No!
% sneak along path (through backyards)
% walk up to scarecrow (weirdness: stuffed with raven feathers, wearing gauntlets)
% lara: "hello, wanna chat with your master"
% no response
% detect magic: faint transfiguration on scarecrow
% debate touching for identify, don't
% follow path, shouting platitudes
% find clearing, big tree, building on hill; approach building
% abjuration skulls on fence posts, goats trapped in pen
% james steps inside after motioning us back
% says "hi, wanna talk to bablisaga". fog swirls into 10ft tall human (not magic)
% "why invade my home, begone I beseech you"; james: prophecy, you might help us
% "whatcha lookin for?" "kneeling woman, rose, yada yada", figure slumps and responds sadly: 200 paces west, monument and treasure
% head west across field, see stone kneeling figure in distance
% raised plot of land enclused by disintegrating iron fence, lifesized stone monument of kneeling peasant girl wearing necklace (abjuration) clutching rose (looks like irena)
% carved into monument: "Marina, taken by the mists" (lara: vampires can turn into mist)
% james steps in carefully, everything goes silent, grabs necklace
% hear many footsteps
% jump on horses and flee north
% james hands me necklace. identify: wonderous cleric-only locket vs vampires
% argue about giving it to ginelle, but she just leaves cause we're iffy
% dan runs off
% we eventually decide to follow, grab wagon along way
% ginelle is asleep
% james, dan, and I head to investigate mansion, no one else wants to come (6PM)
%

% walk to west vallaki main gate
% has zombie guards, approach anyway. they don't react
% head toward mansion
% every window is broken, church is fine but surrounded by undead, no ravens
% enter the mansion (broken front door, shattered windows on first floor)
% nothing cool first floor, check out basement
% crying guy in prison, say we'll come save him later
% dan gives goodberry and tries to open cell. no key, james picks lock, he doesn't want to get out
% back upstairs
% second floor (dex checks)
% viktor's room: untouched, study: missing book starts with "Th" (thick book)
% izek's room: chest with bag, magical (conjuration), open with mage hand (screams, close). identify: bag of holding (750lbs) that screams.
% locked room: handcuffs. boudoir room with magic mirror: dead burgo (choaked) - james loots body (keyring x6)
% mirror identify: conjuration, activated by rhyme "magic mirror on the wall, summon forth your shade, night's dark vengeance head my call and wield your murderous blade". summons spirit of assassin, speak name, it murders that person. it knows distance etc. once per day.
% bit too evil to use now...
% head to attic
% mage hand door open
% completely empty, fuck
% i think we should kill viktor
% cut off mirror, lower it, bring it to main floor carefully. shatter it into bag of holding
% walk out, go to vistani camp the way we came (pass without trace) (8PM)
