Tied down in the middle of a bloody pentagram with a dozen robed figures chanting around him was not how Graham was expecting to spend his Thursday evening. He expected a conversation in a coffee shop, maybe the disappointment of finding out his contact was less useful than he'd hoped, not a sharp pain in the back of his head before waking up here, confused and lost.

Instead, he was bound in rusted chains, tied down in what seemed to be an honest-to-gods filled with flickering candles, bloody diagrams and symbols, hooded cultists in monster masks, and an ornate but dusty *vase* of all things. And his nose was itchy, too, and there was nothing he could do about it.

*"...let Him which has been bound to earth be bound to flesh, and by words, and by chains..."*

And that *fucker* Nolan Sweets! He thought he could trust Nolan, as much as anyone can trust a two-bit, good-for-nothing criminal, which in retrospect probably wasn't all that much at all, but that bastard didn't even have the grace to stay bought! Graham had been scrounging together everything he could save and using it to pay off Nolan -- they'd been working together for months now, until today Graham would have thought that meant there was just a little mutual respect between the two of them, and at least enough of an acquaintanceship to avoid betraying each other so blatantly. Sure, Graham was planning on breaking off their relationship just as soon as he had enough information to finish his paper, but he wasn't planning on *getting rid* of Nolan afterwards; just politely saying goodbye and going his own way.

Graham sighed. So much for that plan.

He thought it was a decent enough idea, too. Not much to do out in the Colonies without the magic to fight on the front lines, not much to do but work as a Normie, trying to make ends meet without a hope in the world of doing better for yourself or your family. Unless you've got the strength to beat back the monsters, what good are you? Never mind that it's the Normies that keep the country running, who make sure there's food for everyone else, who make sure there's heat, and power, and running water for all the Defenders to come back to.

No, Graham wasn't bitter, why do you ask?

*"...and let the covenant be formed, and the chains bind. Let the vessel be bound by the word and the will, and shatter His prison..."*

Not for the first time, Graham felt annoyed at his magic. Illusion magic, sure, maybe at the upper tiers that could be useful against some of the weaker monsters, but with the sort of power Graham held? Respectable enough to be useful for performing, for entertaining the Defenders between deployments, but little else. Working for little pay, just to amuse the upper class who *knew* they were better than him? No, thank you, he'd rather spend his days moving crates of food from point A to point B. The pay would be a bit better and he'd get a bit of satisfaction out of helping keep folks fed at least.

And *Water* Illusion magic? What a joke. Maybe with a strong enough synergy, with Light Illusion magic or Air or -- since it's all in his wildest dreams, why not go big? -- any sort of amalgam, he'd at least have gotten something better than a pitying look when he got tested. Better than a brochure for the sort of positions available to a Normie. Better than the condescending looks of those who tested with better powers, the ones whose names and powers would be shouted out so the whole school could applaud.

But no, there he'd been, a senior in high school with any hopes of a bright future dashed by the dim glow of a testing orb. His mother had been supportive, of course, she always was, but he could still remember the mostly hidden disappointment in her eyes. The resigned acceptance that they'd have to continue barely holding their lives together, barely keeping their bellies filled and their heaters powered for another half dozen years until his baby sister Elizabeth -- *call my Lizzie*, she'd decided a few weeks back, Graham chuckled -- had her chance at something more.

Not that her chances were looking all that good, Graham's amusement faded. Her mother: an Air mage without enough of an Aspect to even register. Her brother: with the useless combination of Water and Illusion -- and neither powerful enough to be useful. He father: who knows? -- but nothing all that impressive according to the few times her mother had been willing to mention him.

Oh, he'd raged against the unfairness of life for a few weeks... a few months, if he was being honest with himself and wasn't pretending his emo phase didn't happen. It wasn't exactly his proudest moment, sure, but he'd pulled himself back together. He'd worked hard to get a job moving boxes; nothing glamourous, sure, but it helped pay the bills. He'd dug into his books, found he had a decent mind for criminal psychology, one of the few jobs around New York where a Normie could be useful and get a bit more pay, put together what he'd thought was a decent application, sent it in while *daring* to feel a bit of hope.

Denied, they'd told him.

"But re-apply next year", they'd said, "you just needed something special for your application to really shine!" No advice on how he was supposed to get that while spending his days lifting and carrying crates, of course, but "we'd be more than happy to re-evaluate you then!"

So he'd hatched a plan. They wanted research on their application, proof of interest and proof of knowledge? Will he'd get them something special -- he'd made his way to a dirty local tavern, been a bit more vocal about his annoyance at the state of things than he normally allowed, and eventually been joined by a shifty-eyed "friend". *Nolan, Nolan Sweets*, he'd introduced himself, and he'd been willing to introduce Graham to some "other, like-minded friends" for a bit of coin.

*"...we beseech thee, mighty Jal'Korazeth, you who slumbers, who is bound but waiting, appear before us, your devoted servants..."*

Graham snorted. Yeah, maybe that one had been a mistake.

Things had been going so well, too! He'd been introduced to a few more folks living at the bottom, folks with an axe to grind towards society. Thieves, protestors, arsonists, a couple forgers, he'd stayed away from anything too serious -- *no serial killers, thank you very much!* -- but even these folks who had barely touched the wrong side of society had their motivations, had their stories to tell. And always Nolan had seemed so content with their deals! Graham would pay off Nolan, get back a time and a place, have a conversation, and repeat it all the next week. His contacts would always meet him in public, they'd both keep hoods drawn and be carefull to avoid names or anything too incriminating, and Graham would get a bit more of a look into how criminals thought. Nolan got a weekly payoff for little effort, the criminal-of-the-week got coin and free drinks, and Graham had been steadily making progress on his paper.

He should have known it wouldn't last. Looking back, his most recent conversation with Nolan, the one immediately before he'd gotten trussed up like a Thanksgiving turkey and tossed in some cult's dungeon, had felt a bit off. Graham hadn't been able to put his finger on it at the time, and brushed it off as the after-effects of a bad day at work, but looking back he realized that Nolan had at least had the good graces to look a bit sheepish at having sold him off to a demon-summoning cult.

*"...come forth from thine prison, and grant what we ask of thee..."*

Graham eyed the now-crumbling pottery sitting in front of him, which had been shaking more and more as the voices of the cultists around him carried on. It couldn't be a good thing that their ritual seemed to be having an effect. It probably wouldn't be great for Graham even if the ritual was doing nothing and they were just misguided crazies, but still... for a while Graham had hoped that the cultists would suddenly stop, rip off their grotesque masks, shout *Surprise!*, and it would all have been some sort of poor joke that he'd be able to laugh at later.

He... wasn't quite so hopeful anymore. Or quite so capable of fooling himself, he supposed.

One thing to be said in favour of being sacrificed by cultists in a lengthy ritual is that it really gives you time to think. At first, sure, Graham had been terrified out of his wits. But as the cultists had finished drawing out the bloody pentagrams and tossed him and the vase in its centre, as they'd moved to speaking in tongues, and then to what might have been Latin, and finally had switched back to English, his heart had started to calm down and his mind had gotten a lot clearer.

Don't misunderstand: he was still terrified. Terrified out of his wits and pretty confident he wasn't making it to morning. But he'd moved pretty rapidly through the stages of grief to resigned acceptance, which a tinge of regret. He thought back to his mother, who may never know what happened to him. To his sister, who he prayed would have better luck than him in life.

*"...Oh, Jal'Corazeth, accept this vessel as our sacrifice!"* the cultists shouted in a final declaration as a swirling wind began to tug incesantly at Grahams robes.

Eh, what does he have to lose at this point?

"Oh, Jal'Corazeth, accept these cultists as my sacrifice!" he shouted in desperate hope.

The wind slowed around him for a moment, the grasping feeling becoming almost inquisitive before the sound of wicked laughter started echoing out of the vase, soft at first before quickly drowning out all other sound in the room.

**"Your offerings are accepted, human."**
