Chaos. Absolute chaos.

With the booming voice's declaration, the vase had *shattered*, hurdling broken shards of pottery around the room, flying past Graham's prone form but otherwise peppering every surface in the room. The walls, the ceiling... one particularly unlucky cultist was caught in the throat and he collapsed with a wet gurgle.

The cultists' previous sounds of confusion were replaced with terror as a swirling wind picked up, capturing the broken pottery along with candles, broken pieces of stone, and other debris. As the candles were snuffed out, the room was plunged into darkness, the only light coming from a glowing shape where the vase used to be.

As the shape grew, its form slowly solidified: a grasping and twisted hand ending in razor sharp talons here; a spiraling curved horn there; a face, half melted, with more eyes than Graham could count. The demon took shape, stepping out into the dungeon with an imperious sort of confidence about him.

It was vaguely human-shaped, Graham supposed, if one was half blind and had only heard a description of a human rather than having seen one themselves. It stood on two legs, one scaly and clawed and the other hooved with an extra joint. As it unfolded itself to its full height, two gnarled and twisted horns nearly scraped on the ceiling. Its face was deformed: half melted on one side, with misshapen eyes dripping down that side, the other side holding multiple closed mouths.

The demon had four arms -- not symmetrical like a human, but sticking out from seemingly random angles. One jutted directly out of the demons chest, another from its left shoulder, the last two coming more from where the back of a human's ribcage would be than from anything resembling shoulders. From behind it a dozen smaller appendages, each whiplike and tipped with a thorny blade, slowly moved through the air.

"No! Back, demon, it was our offering which summoned you, our sacrifice of the vessel you see before you! You will obey our will, you will --" the cultist's angry rant broke off as the demon gestured to him and he began to rise into the air, his limbs splayed out as if pulled in all directions at once. Fully spread-eagle, hovering a foot off the ground, there was a second of pause, then the demon threw two if its arms forwards.

    *R-R-R-I-P!*

A horrendous tearing noise and each of the cultist's limbs was thrown to a different corner of the room. As Graham's eyes widened in fear, he heard a quiet chuckling coming from the demon standing barely a few feet away from him.

**"Not so fast,"** the demon spun around towards a few of the other cultists who had been tripping over each other to reach the only door leading out of the room. Raising one hand, palm up, the demon tightened his hand into a fist. Darkened obsidian spikes pushed upwards from the floor and all the way to the ceiling, blocking off the path ahead.

The cultists, in their hurry to escape, pushed their furthest member ahead and directly into the path of the spikes. His ragged and torn remains, spread between multiple of the spikes, laid testament to that mistake.

The demon strode fowards towards the remaining group of would-be-escapees, one mishapen hand slicing through the air and through the body of one cultist, followed a second later by a swipe of another claw through a second cultist. The demon's face split open in three places, toothy grins filled with sharpened teeth appearing in all of them, as it luxuriated in tearing the cultists limb from limb.

Graham watched as one was torn apart by the demon's bare hands, the demon having reached into the cultist's screaming mouth and torn out his tongue before grabbing both sides of the cultists mouth and ripping. Another was sliced dozens, hundreds, of times, the demon's tails whipping out over and over until the cultist's skin was a mess of spurting red wounds.

From behind Graham, he felt the beginnings of a spell as one of the cultists pulled herself together enough to toss out some magic. Bolts of water, slicing through the air at barely visible speeds, shot across the room towards the demon. Graham had half a moment to feel jealous -- Water and *Evocation*, what he wouldn't give for such a useful Aspect -- before the bolts where intercepted by the demon, its tail whipping back and forth to intercept and disperse the bolts without otherwise interrupting it.

With barely a glance over its shoulder, the demon threw the head of a cultist directly at the one who had dared to attack it. Graham twisted, still on his bindings, to watch the cultist who'd been not quite fast enough to dodge the severed head of her former ally. She was knocked to the ground by the force of it, throwing it to the side and standing up within seconds to continue firing at the demon.

It was too late.

By the time she'd stood up, the demon was upon her. It plunged one fist into her chest, breaking past her ribcage and pulling out her heart. It bit into the heart gleefully before the light in her eyes had fully managed to fade.

Graham had seen enough. He emptied the contents of his stomach onto the floor beside him and curled into a ball, hiding his eyes from the terrible happenings around him. He couldn't ignore the whistling of the demon's claws, the screams of the cultists, or the squishes of... or the other sounds, but he did his best to pretend he was somewhere, anywhere, else.

He stayed like that for what felt like hours, the hideous sounds around him continuing. The occasional sound set his confused mind to figuring out what could have caused it until he could wrest a hold of his imagination and quite firmly convince himself he did *not* want to know, thank you very much.

Eventually, the sounds stopped. Graham kept his eyes covered at first, but soon couldn't shake a sense of expectation enveloping him. With a fortifying deep breath, Graham slowly opened his eyes and took a look around the room.

It was a bloodbath. The entire room had been painted red; the originally horrifying pentagram painted on the floor was no longer even visible other that in the foot or so directly around Graham, which was comparatively quite clean. Now that the room was silent, Graham's ears adjusted enough to hear the more gentle sound of blood dripping down from the ceiling in multiple places.

The spikes which had grown out of the floor near the door were not alone; other spikes -- crude, blackened things, what looked to be obsidian but with a burning red inner flame -- grew out from a few other places of the floor, from various walls, one even grew down from the ceiling and had a torn off leg skewered halfway down its length. In one corner of the room, something was smouldering; here and there through the room, bits of robe and cultist were still burning. Graham wrinkled his nose and tried to think of something else. Elsewhere, the stone ground had momentarily opened up, just long enough for a cultist to fall halfway into the chasm, before grinding back to a close, taking the lower half of the cultist with it.

Graham tore his eyes away from the brutal scene, frantically searching for anything in the room which wouldn't horrify him. Somehow, it was the demon which came closest. The demon was standing still and surveying the room, flexing its arms and tails slowly and methodically, but without making any further agressive moves. As Graham took in the demons form, one of its eyes rolled to the back of its head and blinked languidly.

The demon turned to face Graham, the eye staying fixed on his as the demon's face turned. It was a singularly unsettling feeling to watch and if Graham had anything left in his stomach, he was sure he would be bent double yet again.

The demon smiled with two of its mouths as the other opened to speak. **"That was the singularly most delicious offering I've had in centuries, human. My thanks,"** it rasped. With a start, Graham realized what could only be a contented purring sound was coming from deep in its chest.

The demon licked its lips. **"Jal'Corazeth, third of the Buzdamor Horde, at your service. My friends call me JC."**

Graham fought the urge to faint.

**"Well, speak up, human. There are no bindings upon me, but I'm still inclined to be generous; these fools would have made a mistake and set me free eventually, but your actions have hastened my freedom. If there is a boon you would desire of me, ask it now."**

Graham blinked a few dozen more times before managing to find his voice. "A... boon?" he asked incredulously. "You want to grant me a wish?"

He had to cringe a moment later as the demon's booming laughter echoed around the room. **"A wish? What do you take me for, a djinn? No, human, I can't grant you infinite power or fame or money or anything of the sort. I simply offer something which a powerful *monster*",** at this, its lips twisted sarcastically, **"such as I may grant. Do you have an enemy you wish destroyed? Perhaps a former lover I should eviscerate? A backtabbing ally I could disembowel? I'm particularly partial to a good disemboweling,"**

"No, no, nothing like that. No allies to disembowel, definitely not. I, uh," Graham stuttered, trying to get his mind caught up with the conversation. *Come on, brain, pay attention here!* "Er, anything besides killing that you could do for me? And, uh, are you going to let me live afterwards?"

**"Why not? You haven't acted against me. You humans give demons a bad name, you know. We're not evil, murdering monsters, we just weant to be left alone,"** the demon paused as Graham's eyes involuntarily glanced at the scene of destruction surrounding them. **"Well, not evil at least,"** it sounded almost apologetic. **"These cultists have had me contained for months, this was simply justice and a good chance to stretch my legs.**

**"As for your question, I don't particularly care to do your thinking for you or offer you suggestions; I'm willing to offer a favour in thanks before I leave this place, but it's yours to take or leave,"**

Graham considered his predicament as he stood unsteadily, his arms still chained around his body and his legs chained to the floor. He felt wholely unprepared for this conversation; demons were some of the stronger monsters in the Badlands, a threat very few could deal with. They were made out to be the worst of the worst, difficult for even a trained squad of high-tier Defenders to deal with. They were powerful, they were creative, and -- worst of all -- they were clever and malicious.

What could he ask of a being so much more powerful than himself? Would asking for nothing insult the demon, despite what he said? Would the demon twist his request into something evil, like the Monkey's Paw of a wish from a djinn?

*Oh, crap* had he already insulted the demon by comparing him to a djinn? Was this all just a lead up to some horribly ironic torture and death?

Graham watched with mounting horror as one of the demon's ears slid elsewhere on his head. **"Choose quickly, human, I sense others approaching and will leave before they arrive,"**

Graham's heart leapt for a moment, before he put two and two together. People are approaching? They were clearly in some hidden cultists' dungeon, who else could possibly be approaching but more cultists? And if the demon would be leaving, who would protect him?

This world was built on power. If the cultists had anyone with stronger magic -- *which, let's face it, is pretty much a guarantee* -- he would be caught all over again, this time without a *diabolus ex machina* to save him. Unless...

"Can you make it seem like I was the one who did all this? Make sure they know not to mess with me?" Graham spoke quickly, his mind racing a mile a minute as he imagined scaring the cultists into letting him go.

The demon's eyes and ears shifted again, this time focusing all their attention on Graham. **"Stealing credit for my kills, eh?"** Graham's eyes widened as he opened his mouth to protest, suddenly having realized his request may have been an awful idea. **"No, I do not care for the games of humans. I am willing to honour this request,"**

The demon turned, its eyes roving across the room. After a moment, it began to work its magic: the spikes shifted from glassy obsidian into the same stone as the room itself, jets of flame flew across the room to burn some of the more incriminating teeth marks on the cultists' bodies, and chunks of stone were torn from the walls of the room and strewn about as if they'd been used as weapons.

The demon looked around with a critical eye as the scene changed to something which may have been caused by human hands, albeit terrifying ones. Rather than bite marks and obsidian summoned from Hell, now earth and fire was the cause of their demise. The sheer scale of it was so far beyond what a mage of Graham's talents could have accomplished that it wasn't even funny, but the cultists didn't need to know he was a Normie, did they?

After the scene settled, the demon turned back to him and gave a satisfied grunt. **"Good luck, human,"** it said with a chuckle. It flung forwards two bolts of magic, one headed towards Graham's feet and the other straight towards his chest, before slowly melting into the floor and disappearing from the dungeon.

Graham couldn't help but stumble backwards as the magic bolt hit the ground before his feet and burst into another stone spike, piercing directly through his chains but making his heart skip a beat. The chains slid off his wrists towards the ground as the demon's second bolt hit him directly in the chest.

*This is it,* Graham thought to himself. *Ironic death, here I come.*

He gritted his teeth and braced himself, but after a few moments realized that he was not on fire, or unable to breath, or dying for any other reason. He opened his eyes and took stock of things as he rubbed his sore wrists. It seemed the bolt had done nearly the opposite of what he'd expected: if anything, it made him feel stronger. Looking closely at his arms, he could see glowing red tendrils, almost smoke-like, rising off of him. His body felt hot, almost overheated, but slowly cooling down to a more normal temperature. He felt refreshed, more than refreshed, like he could run a marathon without breaking a sweat.

Graham was interrupted from continuing his thoughts by the door bursting open. He quickly turned to face the door, raising his arms in what he imagined might look like a fighting stance. He took a deep breath and put on his most confident look, as if his strength was a given instead of being an absolute joke. He spoke at the same time as those who had just burst through the doors.

"Stay back, let me leave, and I won't do to you what I did to your friends here!"

"City Defenders, drop your weapons and release your captive!"
