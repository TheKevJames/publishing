"Wait, you did this?" The woman who burst through the dungeon door had her hands raised and her fingers splayed, a gentle light playing across her fingertips. She slid to a stop only a few steps into the room, her eyes quickly widening as she took in the violent destruction.

Graham's thoughts screeched to a stop. Did she say she was a Defender?

"Christ Almighty, this kid did all this?" An older man ran through the door only a second after her, his eyes taking in the scene just as quickly. His eyes paused on Graham for only a moment, clearly pausing on the chains still binding his feet and the glowing aura only now starting to fade. "Jesus, he's still shedding power."

With the arrival of this second person, it became obvious to Graham that the two were in uniform: heavy, dark khakis, a dull green chestplate, battered armguards, the emblem of the Defenders on the left side of their chests and a smaller emblem signifying New York on the other...

*I think they're Defenders.* Graham brain slowly realized it had reached a dead end, paused for a moment to get its bearings, then continued on past his surprise to try to formulate a response. "Yes, that is definitely what I said." *Nailed it*

A third person dashed into the room, but Graham barely had enough time to glance at her before she bent over, one hand covering her mouth, clearly trying to hold her stomach back from heaving. Graham knew how she felt.

"I, wow. Just... wow," The first Defender, a tall and sturdily built woman with ragged blonde hair and pinched features took a few steps closer to Graham as the lights faded from her fingertips. "Apologies for showing up so late, but it sure looks like you had things handled here. Ava Jacobson, Second Rank Mage of the Colonial Defenders."

Graham raised one hand to shake hers and answered without thinking. "Graham Platt, stock clerk."

A burst of laughter from the fourth man to enter made Graham realize what he'd just said. "Er, you know, until I head to Columbia, of course." Graham wondered if the Defenders noticed how much nervous sweat was dripping down his neck.

The fourth man leisurely stepped through the room, hands in his pockets and looking as if he didn't have a care in the world. He took in the still-smouldering and skewered corpses around the room with a lazy expression. "Not even an Acolyte yet? Even I must admit that's impressive. Looks like a decent amount of Fire Evocation and, yeah, pretty bloody strong Earth Transmutation here, at the least. Even without any crossing, that's better than I expected to find in a shithole like this," The man said, somehow with absolutely no sarcasm in his voice. "Reese Abernathy, at your service."

"A pleasure," Graham grimaced even as he saw Reese clearly miss his tone of voice. Up close, he noticed Reese had an entirely different patch on his chestplate, one Graham didn't recognize.

With a smile that nearly reached his eyes, Reese waved an almost negligent hand towards the chains still binding Grahams feet. Not five seconds later the chains had melted into a pool of water around his feet.

"Water Transmuter?" Graham couldn't stop himself from asking with raised eyebrows, barely managing to keep the jealousy out of his voice.

"Nah, Conjurer, I've only got enough Transmutation for some parlor tricks. I've got dual Aspects just like you, though I'm not nearly as jammy," Reese admitted, his jealousy a bit less hidden, not that Graham quite understood that; sure, the Defender must think Graham's *incredible magical powers* were stronger, but dissolving steel chains is certainly more than a parlor trick.

Well that's a weird feeling. Graham thought in disbelief. He couldn't recall anyone being jealous of him since he'd barely light up the testing orb. And the person who's feeling jealous can *dissolve steel with a wave of their hand*. Can't say it feels half bad, though.

"You did all this while chained to the floor?" The third woman had finally gotten her stomach under control, her face tinged pink with what Graham quickly realized was amazement. "Wow, that's amazing!"

Graham had started to stutter out an embarassed denial when Ava interrupted him.

"Alright, alright, no need to crowd the poor kid. Shea, Cleve, Jason," Graham finally noticed the fifth Defender, who'd slipped in behind the others. "give this place another look in case we missed anything on the way down. Reese, you're with me, we'll take Graham back to HQ."

The three she'd mentioned slipped out the door after nodding, Shea tossing an impressed look back over her shoulder before they were out of sight.

"Defender HQ? I appreciate the, uh, the backup, I suppose," Graham felt embrassed referring to what were obviously significantly more powerful mages as if they were playing second-fiddle to him. "But now that Reese has worked his magic and you've cleared out the other cultists, I think I'm good from here. I'm sure I can head home on my own, no problem."

"Sorry, kid, can't break policy here, we just need to get your story, make sure there's nothing we need to follow up on here. These bastards were trying to cut a deal with a demon, that's not something we can let stand; we'll go through everything you can remember as closely as possible and make sure nothing stands out -- won't take too long, and we can drop you off at home right after."

Graham's eyes widened nervously. It's been fun having them all be so impressed, but... Should he admit he'd lied? The penalty for a Normie pretending to be a mage was pretty severe... but what would happen if they realized he was lying? What if they found his records and saw what his real powers were? What if they had a testing orb?

Graham's nervous sweat had pretty much counter-acted the demon's glowing, power-up... thing, whatever it was, by this point, as he realized there was a pretty short list of ways this could go well for him. Admitting he impersonated a mage was a hefty fine, at minimum, not to mention a black mark on his record which would pretty much prevent any chance he had of getting into college... or ever getting a better job...

I just need to fool them for a bit, a couple hours tops. Graham let himself calm down just a bit. They have no reason to test me, and as far as they know I'm just a pre-Acolyte heading to Columbia in the fall so they won't think to look for an adult record... Oh, wow, they think I'm still in highschool.

Graham let out a strangled chuckle. "Sure thing, no problem at all, happy to give you the full story."

*I'm so fucked.*

"Graham Platt, stock clerk."

Reese couldn't help a bursting into laughter as he heard the so-called captive introduce himself to Ava. Sure, a bloody *Normie* managed to take out a bunch of demon-worshipping culty buggers, pull the other one. The bloke's a joker, Reese would give him that.

"You know, until I head to Columbia, of course."

Well that made a bit more sense, Reese whistled quietly as he took in the scene. If any mage in this rubbish country was worth a damn, they'd be headed to Columbia. They'd almost managed to make it to knockouts in last year's Pingbies. Still... "Not even an Acolyte yet? Even I must admit that's impressive."

Reese looked closer at some of the damaged around the room. The spikes couldn't be anything but Earth Transmutation, and the still-burning areas of the room point to a Fire nature of some sort. Doesn't look like any signs of Transmutation nearby, so... a Magma mage? An amalgam, plus two solid Aspects? Can't be, that's a one-in-a-million sort of talent. Maybe a Fire Evoker and an Earth Transmuter? There's not many untrained pure First mages who can manifest an aura like that, though, not without at least a bit of amaglam in them...

"Looks like a decent amount of Fire Evocation and," Reese reached out with his Trasmutation senses to the nearest pillar. He could barely affect it. "Yeah, pretty bloody strong Earth Transmutation here, at the least. Even without any crossing, that's better than I expected to find in a shithole like this!"

Alright, he'll admit it, he was damn impressed. Even if he's being conservative in his estimate, this bloke has got two quality elements with some strong Aspects to back them up. And he swore he saw a flinch from this Graham character when he mused about Graham's powers... yeah, he's even stronger than that, must be.

"Reese Abernathy, at your service." He offered his hand. And this kid hasn't even started college yet? That's a friend he wanted to have. Hmm, actually, if he hasn't even started college yet...

"A pleasure!" Graham responded. Reese offered him a happy smile, still lost in thought. He gestured towards the chains still binding Graham's legs -- and wasn't that even more impressive, that he'd done all this while being chained and unable to move -- trying to make the Transmutation look easier than it was; good thing he'd not had to spend much of his magic yet tonight, or that would have been considerably more difficult.

It took a few seconds for the chains to fully dissolve. *Bollocks*, he'd tried for a more impressive cast than that.

"Water Transmuter?" The prodigy in front of him asked with a raised eyebrow. Reese's heart fell. Yeah, makes sense that someone on that level wouldn't be impressed by his low-level transmutation. He should have Conjured up something more impressive to handle things, that would have been a better show.

"Nah, Conjurer, I've only got enough Transmutation for some parlor tricks. I've got dual Aspects just like you, though I'm not nearly as jammy," Calm down, Reese, you're letting your jealousy show. Three weeks being surrounded by weaklings and suddenly you're salivating over the first real powerhouse you see. That's not the way to impress him!

"You did all this while chained to the floor?" Ugh, speaking of the wrong way to impress someone. Even among the sorry excuses for Defenders they've got out here, Shea barely counts as more than a Normie. She's got to have paid someone off to get tossed onto the right side of the fence. Her Transmutation wasn't even as strong as his and that was her only talent! "Wow, that's amazing!"

Reese snorted and Ava shot him a glance. Oops, a bit too loud, our fancy *Second Rank Mage* is annoyed at me.

"Alright, alright, no need to crowd the poor kid," Ava ordered, clearly talking to Shea. "Shea, Cleve, Jason: give this place another look in case we missed anything on the way down. Reese, you're with me, we'll take Graham back to HQ."

The three hangers-on nodded at Ava and headed out to do their grunt work.

"Defender HQ? I appreciate the, uh, the backup, I suppose, but now that Reese has worked his magic and you've cleared out the other cultists, I think I'm good from here. I'm sure I can head home on my own, no problem." Wow, and wasn't that a kick in the pants? Graham was being generous, pretending they'd been at all helpful, but everyone here knew he was just being polite. *Appreciate the backup*, indeed.

"Sorry, kid, can't break policy here, we just need to get your story, make sure there's nothing we need to follow up on here." Yeah, and give me a better chance to get on your good side, Graham thought. Maybe convince him how much better off he be at Cambridge... "These bastards were trying to cut a deal with a demon, that's not something we can let stand; we'll go through everything you can remember as closely as possible and make sure nothing stands out -- won't take too long, and we can group you off at home right after."

Graham chuckled at them, as if the though of the cultists succeeding at summoning a demon was something to laugh at. And, Reese supposed, to someone capable of doing *this*, it would be pretty laughable, wouldn't it?

"Sure thing, no problem at all, happy to give you the full story." Reese's eyes widened in excitement at hearing more of what happened here.

*I'm so excited*
