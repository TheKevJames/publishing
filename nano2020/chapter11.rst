tourney interrupted, protecting the city marked as tourney goal

perhaps some more specific objectives over time

some monster skirmishes, protag proud of himself for being able to fight one or two monsters at once
    even his healer teammate taking down dozens at once

in the wilds, multiple teams captured by demons (incl cassie? or her plan?)
    could be her trying to eliminate him -- but not too actively
    considered him a bit of a threat, but more jostling and testing than anything else

demons recognize his mark from JC, give him a boost and let him win and free allies
