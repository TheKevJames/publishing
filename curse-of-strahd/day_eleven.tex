% The Sixteenth Day of the Ninth Moon, Year 735

% I ask burgo for help getting stronger, ginelle butts in "to help kill strahd". burgo is too scared, tries to leave. ginelle casts "suggestion" and james engages sword, me and lara peace out to not be a part of this
% guardsmen: anything weird? trader: Yuri Volkovich (trader) goes between here and vallaki
% head to vallaki to get elf then plan to head to temple
% vallaki: ground looks to be dying
% send dan to talk to elf (kasameer)
% kasameer: "its gone be cold. I have a ring of warming but fuck you guys"
% arigal and luvash come back from hunting
% chat about magic with kasameer
% have to ditch caravan. continue on, gets colder
% amber temple: has amber statues around it
% sign: "guard the darkness for the light"
% start exploring with dancing lights
% giant lightning bolt, knocks out elwing and kasameer, we run
% green floating skulls go after us, i run more into altar room (come after me guys, choke point!)
% investigate while I wait for them, find guy behind altar "woah, didn't expect to see anyone here, who are you?"
% lara and steve rush in
% guy is charred, backs away "what are you doing here, what do you want?"
% "exploring for source of power, just dealing with some things attacking us"
% everyone else charges in
%

% "who are you, sup doc?"
% "wizard apprentice, firebolt+eat rats, this place is terrifying. creatures everywhere, there's like a minotaur and all"
% master's spellbook and staff need to be recovered, might be a golem outside
% lara wants to trick him (fake amber) -- nah
% finally decide to lure fire ghosts in one by one, lara goes light-rock-fishing, catches nothing. they're gone
% go back out towards hole in the ground, fight skulls because they're blocking the shaft exit and golem is coming
% kill them, but picolo dies to fireball, ginelle revivify's him
% climb down hole
% amber crystals with blackness and heavy door -- they open, I identify amber
% a burst of howling wind is heard inside your head and it slowly begins to quiet being a faint whisper you then hear a voice:
% "My name is Zrin-Hala. Will you make a pact with me?"
% Who are you? (pause) Yes, I'll make a pact with you.
% My name is Zrin-Hala, The Howling Storm.
% What pact do you speak of?
% I will bestow a gift upon you and in return you will bear a semblance of myself
% I... yes, yes I'll accept this gift of yours.
% Make a pact with me and I will give you power to create lightning
% How can I make this pact?
% Prostrate yourself before me and speak aloud your acceptance of my pact
% I do so
% feel a pressence from the black mark in the amber, feel empowered, energy through arms, left side of face droops (learn to cast lightning bolt)
% Kinnaeia and Kasamir go to the other two amber statues, feel more presences
% I go for the east one as well, "Sykane, the Soul Hungerer" offers raising the recently dead
% I agree, fall to the ground clutching head and hear two voices fighting for dominance. Mine own is best and supersedes them. Whites of eyes are sickly yellow
% NEW FLAW: If I help someone, I expect payment in return.
% I consider heading for the last one, but Kasamir warns me away. I'm not sure I trust him, but...
% nah!
% accept next pact. I smell shitty, no one can stand within 5 feet of me without smell. Can cast Contagion
% contain the three minds within mine
% continue out -- ginelle tries to prevent me from making more pacts, doesn't give a good reason
% voices in my head tell me to ignore her
% that's a bit suspicious
% Savnok the inscrutable - protect your mind. Hell yeah, might help! My eyes liquify but I can still see. Permanent Mind Blank
% the protecting my mind doesn't help against the voices. Fuck. Ok, not gonna go for others (flight [james got wings], persuasion)
%

% Zrin-Hala, the Howling Storm is very dramatic and domineering in his speak.
% Fekre, Queen of Poxes is dismissive and speaks as if her even speaking to you is a great honor for you.
% Sykane, the Soul Hungerer is almost begging for you to agree to join him.
% Savnok the Inscrutable is very straightforward and to the point, not even bothering to introduce himself, his name only given after acceptance.

% internal monologuing as james and lara explore around the area
% other three block off a door, too distracted to ask about it
% try to pretidigitate the smell away but no
% magical darkness enshrouded statue head. arcana: is magic.
% something scares james+lara, they run past me, I follow
% james flies up, I lose him, join the others in a room
% ginelle: prayer of healing. tell lara to open door, she screams and closes the door
% she thinks of alchemist's fire, I think the nothics are cyclops and tell her to throw then braces the door
% she leans out, says hello. they screech back, can't recognize as language. she continues chatting pointlessly
% she sets down the fire and says "don't worry about it, man"
% she walks out of room, shrieks, comes back and says "too many"
% I offer Comprehend Languages as option, Ginelle beings Augury'ing
% by the time I ritual cast it, they're gone
% fuck
% fekre smirks
% the others charge into the room and get lighninged. wow, dumbasses
% I go on looking for the enemies
% the room attacked james
% "oh I hear voices, are they back?" scuttles in. they're very confused, wary of me, i try to be inviting and mime
% sound of lara exploding a door
% they catch james' eyes: "I guess they're friends..." "fearful one no significant magical ability" "james seeks power" "meh, no idea"
% mime my ears for understanding
% "he can hear us but something?" "obviously, he has cast some spell to understand us. he has robes, spellbook, clearly a caster" I nod
% "I still can't get anything from him" "man up"
% tries to take book, bat hand away
% offer green illusion potion, point to ear. they try to take, pull potion and point at ear. "what's this guys? problem"
% "ugh stench" backs off "another one around corner" lara walk over
% tell lara what to think (trade potion for knowledge: way out and power source)
% "oh, he wants to trade. wow, fucking stinks"
% "he wants arcane power? us too. amber crystals to the north are cool" "like the one we broke?" smacks him
% "if you hand me your book, I'll give it back, and I'll tell you how to open the sealed doors"
% through lara: "we can get through doors, I need to know the things I asked for"
% "you've been breaking, we've seen you!" lara: "isn't that fine?" disdain
% lara must have mistranslated, try again: "power source and how to escape?"
% "front door?" "not now" "..."
% "sealed away dark gods"
% way out beside front door?
% "spellbook to get pointed in the right direction"
% ugh spellbook. through lara: can you ask if they would trade for anything else?
% nope but throw in statue (misinterpretation, only statue!!)? hand him spellbook. he gets excited, eye turns yellow, speedreads through spellbook
% "main room statue: door in back of statue bring you to head. arcanaloth is last defender of this place. "
% "nothing new" hands back book. they leave (pleasure doing business: yeah, you're useless)
% maybe james should follow. nah, loot. bunch of loot, holy shit.
%

% start detecting magic while other two look around
% during detect magic, lots of confusion in head
% emmeral starts feeling around randomly
% lara checks out room past fissure in wall, shouts out: "more amber things"
% emmeral gets bitchslapped, I keep casting
% lara runs into room: "fuck, zombies, run". run in fear, lara grabs james
% pass the others, shout "zombies", run past them into room
% they follow, lara+james follow, decide to fight (steven prepares fireball)
% lara opens door, steven launches fireball
% lara opens door to throw alchemists fire, we launch a bunch of attacks
% ginelle medallion stuns them all
% contagion one of them, james melts it. basically, we murder them all
% brooms are transmutation. identify: broomstick
% they all want to sleep, I head back to detect magic thingy. golem is in center
% no magic in piles, including crown, golem=transmutation
% slow rest ends, we sneak past golem
% boxes of vampires, dirt from vallaki, very intricate room with golden staircase, three more dark gods
% james: z'dune, corpse star -- raise ancient dead; nothing (disdain); nothing (condescention)
% middle one for me is condescention (my voices are fearful), I am questioning, it: "you show talent, but you are weak and unworthy", "how do I prove worth?", presence retreats
% west one (my voices urge no), I imagine presence observed me briefly and smirked, "I see you are willing to do what it takes to gain powers" "I am, are there any powers you would be willing to offer me?" "while I could offer the greatest power of immortality within these walls, you do not seem desperate enough" "desperate? no, but I'd be willing to do what it takes to prove my worth" "if you were so willing to prove your thirst for power, you must destroy a life that reveres you and then drink its essence" "thanks, I'll get back to you" "not desperate enough"
% ginelle tries, gets annoyed, backs off, tells us no
% steven goes for corpse star. he looks as if he's undead
% everyone starts heading upstairs, I follow
% start comprehend-languages'ing a scroll for james->ginelle
% scroll of greater restoration. comprehend tells me nothing (yada yada restoration energies?)
% start to identify book
% they all start exploring, go through wall
% dan: "dude in there, gonna grab a book, don't worry about it", goes back in
% comes back out with lara and book, followed by skeleguy, he demands book back
% skeleton (lich?) with magic and stuff, wants his book (the incants of exethanter) back, we can read others
% ginelle wants to identify him, he says yeah.
% he chats with steven (know me? nah. sister patrica? nah. whats the date? no idea)
% ginelle: he has dimensia. greater restoration? "huh?" does it immediately
% seems to affect him. "my that feels better, wow"
%

% oh wow you folks talked to a lot of people. who'd you talk to? and how about you?
% you talked to a bunch, wow
% he runs over to book
% each book has a code word, so I'll reveal any you bring to me
% I found this library forever ago, looking for long-lost legacy, found this hundreds of years ago
% how do you read? I don't need eyes, I have magic! Agreed, ditto with my legs, they got tired and took a nap
% .. reading book form steven in weird language
% ginelle mentioned lightning, he goes and disenchants "someone enchanted my statue"
% skulls are his, they came from the acolytes
% brings us to food, walks us through temple, asks more questions
% james has to consume bones every day or die. he's totally ok with that
% he leads us through the dungeon, shows us around
% gets pissed off at eye things for breaking shit, kills them all
% opens some doors, we get surprised by invisible monster thing killing people
% contagion it, flesh rot
% dies eventually. poisons us but w/e

% guy is embarrassed, wants us to leave so he can clean up
% yada yada, no one cares, something about lara trying to convince him to tell us more?
% we find out how to kill strahd, how he became immortal, etc
% guy tp's us out
% our horses died cause we left them in the cold
% go to vistani camp, they're annoyed we killed the horses
% long rest

\sleep
