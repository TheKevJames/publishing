\subsection{Telescopes: Portals of Discovery}
Two most important properties of telescopes:
\begin{itemize}
\item Light-collecting area: Telescopes with a larger collecting area can gather a greater amount of light in a shorter time.
\begin{itemize}
\item $A = \pi r^2$
\end{itemize}
\item Angular resolution: Telescopes that are larger are capable of taking images with greater detail.
\begin{itemize}
\item minimum angular separation the telescope can distinguish, diffraction limit is caused by interference of light waves in telescope (larger = less interference)
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
Two basic designs:
\begin{itemize}
\item refracting: focus light with lenses
\begin{itemize}
\item need to be long and large with heavy lenses
\end{itemize}
\item reflecting: focus light with mirrors
\begin{itemize}
\item larger diameters
\item most common
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
Uses of telescopes:
\begin{itemize}
\item imaging: pictures
\begin{itemize}
\item record only one color at a time
\item use color to represent invisible light
\end{itemize}
\item spectroscopy: breaking up light spectra
\item time monitoring: watching how light output of object varies with time
\end{itemize}

Problems:
\begin{itemize}
\item twinkling: turbulence in earths atmosphere distorts veiw and causes stars to twinkle (can be fixed by rapidly changing the shape of the mirror)
\item light pollution
\item certain wavelengths cannot pierce atmosphere
\begin{itemize}
\item gamma rays - 10km, balloons
\item x rays - 100km, rockets
\item ultraviolet - some reach earth but some require rockets
\item visible - reaches ground
\item infrared - 5km, some mountains, planes
\item radio - reaches ground
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Telescopes:
\begin{itemize}
\item radio: giant mirror that reflects radio waves to focus point
\item infrared and ultraviolet: like visible telescopes but need to be above the atmosphere
\item x-ray: also need to be above atmosphere, mirrors arranged to focus x-ray photons through grazing bounces off of mirrors
\item gamma-ray: also need to be above atmosphere, fucking hard to focus gamma rays
\end{itemize}

Multiple telescopes (Inferometry) increase the angular resolution of a single large image.
